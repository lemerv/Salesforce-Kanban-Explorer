Please continue item 8 (virtualize cards per column) and item 9 (server-side filtering/search/pagination) in performance-improvements-plan.md. For each item, restate the item in plain English, ask if I understand it or want clarifications, then ask one implementation question at a time with an explainer. Keep going until you’re 95% confident.

## 1) Item: Skip full filter-definition rebuilds when records are unchanged

**What it is**
Filter definitions are the data objects that drive the filter dropdowns (field, options, selected values, open state, button class). Today they are rebuilt by scanning the full `relatedRecords` dataset every time `rebuildColumnsWithPicklist()` runs.

**Why it matters**
Filter definition building is O(n) over all records and is triggered by interactions like search and filter toggles. With 100+ records, this repeated scan adds noticeable lag even though the underlying dataset hasn’t changed.

**High-level approach**
Rebuild filter definitions only when the record snapshot or filter field configuration changes. For search/filter interactions, reuse existing definitions and only update selection state, then rebuild columns.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/boardInteractions.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/filterUtils.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Mark filters dirty in `handleConfigChange()` on any config change.
- Mark filters dirty in `applyCardRecordsSnapshot()` whenever a new snapshot is applied.
- In `rebuildColumnsWithPicklist()`, rebuild filter definitions only when dirty, then clear the dirty flag immediately.
- Keep a defensive short-circuit inside `buildFilterDefinitions()` to skip work when filters are not dirty.
- Continue to call `updateFilterSelection()` on toggle events to keep UI state accurate.
- Store `filtersDirty` on the component instance, defaulting to `true`.
- When config is missing and state is cleared, leave `filtersDirty = true` so a later valid config rebuilds filters.
- When not dirty, keep minimal UI-state sync (active menu, button classes) without rebuilding options.
- Recompute `buttonClass` from `selectedValues` during the minimal sync.
- Validate `activeFilterMenuId` still exists; close menus if it does not.
- Recompute `isOpen` from `activeFilterMenuId` during the minimal sync.
- Keep menu outside-click listener state in sync (unregister when no menus are open).
- Add debug logging for “filters rebuilt vs skipped” and gate it behind `debugLogging`.
- Emit the “rebuilt vs skipped” logs inside `boardInteractions.buildFilterDefinitions()`.
- During minimal sync, recompute option `selected` flags from `selectedValues`.
- Prune invalid `selectedValues` during minimal sync to future-proof against stale options.
- Set `filtersDirty` regardless of `_isConnected` (so early lifecycle changes are captured).

**Risks and edge cases**

- Stale filter options if the snapshot change isn’t detected correctly.
- Filters that depend on display formatting (e.g., date/time format changes) may also need to mark filters as dirty.

## 2) Item: Make search debounce trailing-only and remove duplicate event triggers

**What it is**
Switch search input handling to a trailing-only debounce and ensure only one event path triggers search updates (prefer `input` over both `input` + `keyup`).

**Why it matters**
The current search handlers can trigger frequent rebuilds while the user types, which compounds UI lag as record count grows.

**High-level approach**
Use a trailing-only debounce for search updates and wire a single event handler so each keystroke doesn’t schedule multiple rebuilds.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/boardInteractions.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.html`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanBoardActions/*`

**Possible strategy**

- Implement a dedicated search debounce wrapper to handle trailing debounce with leading edge on empty → non-empty.
- Remove duplicate wiring so only `input` triggers search updates.
- Keep debounce delay at 200ms for now.
- Use trailing debounce with a leading option only when the search transitions from empty to non-empty.
- Place the wrapper in `boardInteractions.js` alongside search handlers.
- Use a dedicated component field (e.g., `_searchDebounceHandler`) and update `clearDebouncedSearch()` to match.
- Detect empty → non-empty using the normalized (trimmed) value.
- Execute the leading call immediately (no debounce) on empty → non-empty.
- Remove unused `handleSearchKeyup` to avoid dead code.
- Add/update unit tests in both `lresKanbanExplorer` and `lresKanbanBoardActions` to cover search handler wiring and debounce behavior.
- Allow trailing call after a leading update on empty → non-empty.
- Normalize once in the wrapper and pass the normalized value through.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Slight delay before search updates (tune delay for usability).
- No additional debug logging for debounce timing.

## 3) Item: Coalesce heavy rebuilds into the next animation frame

**What it is**
Batch multiple rebuild triggers into a single `requestAnimationFrame` so the UI can paint before heavy work runs.

**Why it matters**
Rapid UI interactions can trigger repeated rebuilds; coalescing reduces redundant work and improves perceived responsiveness.

**High-level approach**
Wrap `rebuildColumnsWithPicklist()` calls in a scheduler that queues one rebuild per frame and cancels prior pending requests.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/boardInteractions.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Schedule rebuilds in the specific user interaction handlers (search input + filter option toggle), not in `rebuildColumnsWithPicklist()`.
- Use a single shared RAF scheduler for search + filter toggles, track a pending RAF id on the component and cancel/reschedule as needed.
- RAF callback uses the latest component state (no captured args).
- Cancel any pending RAF callback in `disconnectedCallback()`.
- Ensure the final state is applied after the last interaction in a burst.
- Apply RAF coalescing only for user-driven rebuild triggers (search/filter/sort), not data refreshes.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Slight delay (1 frame) before updates appear.
- No additional debug logging for RAF scheduling.
- Tests should assert scheduling is triggered in the correct handlers (via `lresKanbanExplorer` tests), without relying on RAF timing.

## 4) Item: Memoize per-record field extraction/display values

**What it is**
Precompute and cache derived field values for each record once per snapshot, reuse them for filtering, search, sorting, and card rendering.

**Why it matters**
Field extraction and formatting are repeated across multiple passes (filters, search, summaries). Caching reduces redundant work.

**High-level approach**
Build a record-id keyed cache during `applyCardRecordsSnapshot()` and have extraction helpers read from it.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/columnBuilder.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/boardInteractions.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Cache per-record computed values (raw + display) for fields used by filters/search/cards.
- Invalidate cache on snapshot/config changes.
- Key cache entries by fully qualified field names to avoid collisions.
- Store cache as `Map<recordId, Map<fieldName, { raw, display }>>` for performance and safety.
- Populate the cache eagerly on snapshot/config changes.
- Eagerly populate using the union of search, filter, card, sort, and summary fields.
- Wire cache usage into `extractFieldData` only (single integration point).
- If cache is missing for a field, fall back to the existing computation.
- Populate cache after record normalization (`normalizeCardRecords`).
- Clear/rebuild cache when the record snapshot or filter field configuration changes.
- Add debug logging for cache build/clear events, gated by `debugLogging`.
- Add unit tests in `lresKanbanExplorer` to confirm `extractFieldData` uses cached values (cache hit vs fallback).

**Risks and edge cases**

- Memory overhead and cache invalidation complexity.

## 5) Item: Defer summary calculations (placeholders first, compute after render)

**What it is**
Render the board immediately with placeholder summary values, then compute and populate summaries after the main UI has painted.

**Why it matters**
Summary calculations are synchronous today and block the main thread during rebuilds. Deferring them improves perceived responsiveness without relying on cache correctness.

**High-level approach**
Split summary rendering into two phases: a fast initial render (no summaries or placeholders), followed by an asynchronous summary computation pass that updates each column’s summaries.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/summaryValueUtils.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/columnBuilder.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Build columns without summaries in the first pass and display a small loading spinner per summary row (replacing each value).
- Schedule summary computation asynchronously for all columns via `requestAnimationFrame`, then update summaries in one pass.
- Reuse existing summary calculation logic (`buildLaneSummaries`) for the deferred pass.
- Update summaries by rebuilding a new `columns` array with updated summary data.
- Show summary spinners only when summaries are configured and there are records.
- Only show summary spinners for columns that have records.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Summaries appear after a short delay; users may notice the placeholder.
- Cancel or ignore stale summary computations if a new rebuild happens before completion.
- Delay summary warning messages until summaries are computed.
- Add unit tests in `lresKanbanExplorer` to verify deferred summary placeholders and eventual summary population.

## 6) Item: Reduce drag-and-drop UI lag (hover/dragover lifecycle)

**What it is**
Improve responsiveness of hover, dragover, and drop-target highlighting by reducing event churn and DOM work during drag operations.

**Why it matters**
The laggy hover/drag lifecycle is a major UX issue with large boards; users can’t tell if a card is grabbed or which column is targeted.

**High-level approach**
Minimize drag event work during interactions and avoid unnecessary re-renders while a drag is active.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanBoardContainer/lresKanbanBoardContainer.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanColumn/lresKanbanColumn.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanCard/lresKanbanCard.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Throttle dragover events so column highlight updates are rate-limited.
- Avoid state updates when the active drop target hasn’t changed.
- Consider lightweight CSS-only hover effects that do not trigger LWC state changes.
- Use a 50ms throttle interval for drag events.
- Implement throttling in `lresKanbanBoardContainer` for centralized control.
- Use always-on CSS-only dragged-card styling to avoid board-wide re-renders on drag start.
- Remove `draggedRecordId` propagation and rely on local CSS class updates for drag styling.
- Apply/remove the drag styling class within `lresKanbanCard` on dragstart/dragend.
- Update `lresKanbanCard` tests to validate the new drag styling behavior.
- Split into two sub-items: (A) dragover/dragenter/leave throttling + gating, (B) drag-start styling optimization.
- Apply the drag styling class directly to the card `<article>` element.
- Remove the drag styling class unconditionally on `dragend` (including canceled drags).
- Keep the existing `.is-dragging` class name.
- Keep drag-start styling visual-only (no ARIA changes for now).
- Keep dragenter/dragleave immediate (no throttling), only throttle dragover.
- Use leading + trailing behavior for dragover throttling.
- Implement dragover throttling with a simple manual timestamp check.
- Store throttle state as fields on `lresKanbanBoardContainer` for easy reset/cleanup.
- Reset throttle state on dragend, drop, and when leaving the board.
- Add basic tests to assert dragover gating behavior without timing assertions.
- Add dragover gating tests in `lresKanbanBoardContainer`.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Over-throttling can make highlight feedback feel sluggish.
- Need to ensure final drop target state is always applied.

## 7) Item: Optimistic drag-and-drop updates with partial refresh

**What it is**
Update the UI immediately on drop, update the record in the background, and refresh only affected columns (or roll back on error).

**Why it matters**
Dragging feels laggy because the UI waits for the server and a full refresh before reflecting the new column.

**High-level approach**
Adjust local state on drop, fire the update, then reconcile on success/failure without full refresh.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/boardInteractions.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/columnBuilder.js`

**Possible strategy**

- Move the record between columns in memory immediately.
- Call `updateRecord`, then either commit or revert on error.
- Do not update counts/summaries optimistically; wait for server confirmation.
- Apply a visual-only move (update columns) without mutating `relatedRecords` until server confirmation.
- Always run the full Apex refresh after a successful drop to re-sync card details.
- On update failure, immediately revert the visual move before showing the error toast.
- Show a lightweight “saving” indicator on the moved card while the update is in flight.
- Start with a simple dimming CSS class for the saving state (can be upgraded to an icon later).
- Track saving state on the moved card object in `columns` (e.g., `card.isSaving`).
- Append the moved card to the bottom of the target column during the optimistic phase.
- Block further drags of a card while it is in the saving state.
- Keep the full-refresh loading overlay behavior after drop (no background refresh).
- Do not auto-scroll; leave visibility of appended card to the user.
- Add unit tests for optimistic drag/drop (visual move, saving state, rollback on error).
- Cover optimistic drag/drop in `lresKanbanExplorer` integration tests.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Need robust rollback on failure and careful sync with server state.

## 8) Item: Virtualize cards per column (windowing)

**What it is**
Render only visible cards per column with a small buffer; avoid rendering all cards at once.

**Why it matters**
Large DOM trees and per-card rendering cost are a major source of lag with 100+ records.

**High-level approach**
Introduce a windowing layer based on scroll position and only render a slice of records.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanColumn/lresKanbanColumn.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanColumn/lresKanbanColumn.html`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanBoardContainer/lresKanbanBoardContainer.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanCard/lresKanbanCard.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanBoardContainer/lresKanbanBoardContainer.css`

**Possible strategy**

- Track scroll position and compute a visible range + buffer.
- Render only the visible range and update on scroll.

**Risks and edge cases**

- Drag-and-drop interactions and scroll positioning need careful handling.

## 9) Item: Server-side filtering/search/pagination

**What it is**
Move filtering/search and paging into Apex so the client handles a smaller dataset.

**Why it matters**
Large datasets amplify client-side processing; server-side filtering reduces work in the browser.

**High-level approach**
Extend Apex to accept filter/search inputs and return paged results.

**Key components involved**

- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/dataModeService.js`
- `force-app/main/default/lwc/lresKanbanExplorer/lresKanbanExplorer.js`
- Apex controller (e.g., `LRES_KanbanCardRecordsController`)

**Possible strategy**

- Add filter/search parameters to Apex methods.
- Implement paging and update the client to request pages.

**Risks and edge cases**

- More complex backend logic and possible changes to filter semantics.
